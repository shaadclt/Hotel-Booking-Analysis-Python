## Introduction

The Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis project uses Python to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about hotel bookings and cancellations. By examining various features such as booking dates, customer details, and hotel characteristics, this project aims to gain insights into the reasons behind cancellations and identify potential trends.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset that includes information about hotel bookings, including customer demographics, booking dates, hotel type, and whether the booking was eventually canceled. The dataset can be found in the file `hotel_bookings.csv` and will be used for the analysis.

## Setup

To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Python.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset file `hotel_bookings.csv` and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

To perform the hotel booking cancellation analysis, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Python libraries and modules in your script.

2. Load the dataset using a library such as pandas.

3. Preprocess the dataset, which may include handling missing values, data cleaning, and feature engineering.

4. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain initial insights into the dataset. This may involve creating visualizations, calculating summary statistics, or identifying patterns and correlations.

5. Perform more in-depth analysis to investigate factors related to hotel booking cancellations. This could include examining cancellation rates based on customer demographics, booking channels, hotel characteristics, or other relevant features.

6. Generate visualizations or statistical analysis results to present the findings of the analysis.

7. Interpret the results and draw conclusions about the factors influencing hotel booking cancellations.

Feel free to customize the analysis according to your specific requirements and explore additional research questions related to hotel bookings and cancellations.
