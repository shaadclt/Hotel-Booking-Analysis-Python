The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are canceled and those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of reservations that have not been canceled. There are still 37% of clients who canceled their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotel's earnings.

In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It is possible that the resort hotels are more expensive.

The line graph above shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel, and on certain days, it is even less. Further, on weekends and holidays there is a rise in resort hotel rates.

To find out and analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels, a grouped bar chart was plotted. It was found from the plot that the month of August has the largest number of not cancelled reservations and the highest number of reservation cancellations was in the month of January.

This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are more when prices are high and are less when price is low. Therefore, the number of cancellations is directly proportional to the cost.

Furthermore, It was found that around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of the clients book hotels directly by visiting them.

Suggestion
1.	Cancellations are higher when the prices are higher. Therefore, in order to reduce the number of cancellations, hotels could revise their prices and could also provide discounts to the customers.
